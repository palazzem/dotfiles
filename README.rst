DotFiles
========

A complete list of configuration files that I use for any application and service.

It works very well with the `developer orchestration tool`_.

.. _developer orchestration tool: https://github.com/palazzem/ansible-devel/

Usage
-----

Clone this repository in your ``$HOME`` folder and then create all required symbolic links:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone https://github.com/palazzem/dotfiles.git
    $ ln -s $HOME/dotfiles/nvimrc $HOME/.nvimrc

That's it!
